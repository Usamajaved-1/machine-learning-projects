population data
take whole data at once 
 and sample data 
take some dat afrom population data
what is statistics?
mathematicals and tolls that enable us to retrive important information 
divided into two categories :
 dcriptive:
retrive information from the whole data ss attach
infresntial :
work on sample data from the population 
next on jupyter notebook
